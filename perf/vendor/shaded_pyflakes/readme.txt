SHADED PYFLAKES
===============

This is essentially a snapshot of Pyflakes at commit be88036019005b769596ca82fb7b82dfdffdca0f,
(you can browse the full file set at https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/tree/be88036019005b769596ca82fb7b82dfdffdca0f)
just with a lot of modifications to make it work almost exactly the way Perf needs it to.

Please avoid modifying it here, instead, modify it upstream (https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes).

This isn't really vendored in the general sense, because it is highly modified.
This will only be patched from upstream in the case of a security issue.
